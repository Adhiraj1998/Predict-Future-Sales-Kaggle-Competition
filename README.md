# Predict-Future-Sales-Kaggle-Competition
This repository contains a working LSTM model for the Kaggle Competition to Predict Future Sales of a Russian Software firm. The Python code has been created using Google Colaboratory, a version of the Jupyter notebook using the existing framework of Google Drive.

From the Kaggle Competition description:
"This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course. 
In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company.  
We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills."
